# Level editor

You have the amazing Arkanoid level editor at your disposal! It lets you create brand new levels and gives you the flexibility to adjust the number of rows and columns in them. But be aware that if you modify these parameters, the canvas will be cleared, removing any existing content.

The level editor offers a wide range of eight different brick colors, each with its own unique properties. This diverse palette allows you to design visually stunning and strategically diverse levels.

If you want to use previously saved data, you can easily load your progress using the "load progress" feature located in the navigation bar. However, please note that only file texts that meet specific conditions and are considered valid levels can be successfully loaded into the editor.

Once you've carefully crafted a level and decide to save it, the level will be promptly sent to the backend of the Arkanoid game. This ensures that your creation becomes a playable level in the game, immediately visible for everyone to enjoy.

While unleashing your creativity, keep in mind that the maximum number of rows allowed is 10, and the column count is limited to 20. Sticking to these boundaries ensures optimal gameplay and level design.

Now, let's take a look at an example map inspired by the popular game "Among Us." This map will give you a glimpse of the exciting possibilities that await you in the Arkanoid level editor!

## Load and save progress

In the editor, you have the awesome ability to load and save your progress effortlessly.

Loading levels is a breeze â€“ simply choose the file you want to load within the editor. No need to mess around with manual customizations. This feature lets you pick up right where you left off.

Saving levels is just as easy. You have two options: save them to your local hard drive or send them to our backend server. Saving locally keeps your levels secure on your own computer, giving you the freedom to share them or move them around as you please. And when you send a level to the backend, it instantly appears in your level selection menu, accessible across devices. So, you can always find your levels, no matter where you are.

With our load and save progress feature, managing your levels is a breeze. You can create, modify, and store your game levels with confidence, all while enjoying a seamless and fun experience in the editor.
